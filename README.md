Progress Updates:

August 20th progress:
![Landing page](/readme_img/august_20_landing.png "Landing page day 1")

I made a single view react native app, yay!

August 22nd: 
![Login page](/readme_img/august_22_login.png "login day 2")

I made a login page! It actually calls an api! The API is fake, but since it's the same fake API we sued when we were testing the web app that means it should be good to go when I'm ready to switch on the real deal data! I spent so much time on this deciding what library to use to make the page scroll slightly up when the keyboard comes up onto the screen but then in the end I decided I should just move everything a little up because it looks kinda weird when it moves. :/
